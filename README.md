# Course Description: Cybersecurity Detection Skills for Students

## Course Title: Mastering Cybersecurity Detection: From Basics to Advanced Techniques
- **Duration**: 9-11 Weeks
- **Level**: Beginner to Advanced
- **Created by**: 0xPh4z3d0ut
- **Date**: June 12, 2025

Dive into the dynamic world of cybersecurity detection with this comprehensive, hands-on course inspired by real-world insights from industry experts. Designed for students and aspiring cybersecurity professionals, this program equips you with the skills to identify and counter sophisticated threats using advanced data sources and techniques. Starting with the limitations of traditional detection methods (e.g., EventID and CommandLine analysis), you’ll progress to mastering Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), Registry analysis, and countering evasion tactics like command line spoofing. Through a structured curriculum, you’ll explore diverse telemetry, develop detection workflows, and synthesize your knowledge in a capstone project simulating real-world scenarios.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understand the pitfalls of basic detection and the importance of diverse data sources.
- Gain proficiency in leveraging ETW and Registry data for tamper-resistant monitoring.
- Learn to detect and mitigate command line spoofing and other evasion techniques.
- Build and refine a detection engineering workflow using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## Course Features
- **Hands-On Exercises**: Practical labs using PowerShell, Event Viewer, and virtual machines to analyze ETW traces, Registry entries, and spoofed processes.
- **Resources**: Curated materials from Microsoft Learn, MITRE ATT&CK, Elastic Security Labs, Splunk, and SANS Institute, updated as of June 2025.
- **Deliverables**: Written reports, scripts, and a capstone project with screenshots to showcase your skills.
- **Prerequisites**: Basic Windows knowledge, command-line familiarity, and a virtual machine setup.

## Who Should Enroll
- Students new to cybersecurity seeking a strong foundation.
- Intermediate learners aiming to specialize in detection engineering.
- Professionals transitioning into security roles or preparing for certifications like SANS FOR508.
